          This Privacy Policy explains how {siteConfig.name} (&ldquo;we&rdquo;,
          &ldquo;us&rdquo;, or &ldquo;our&rdquo;) collects and uses information
          when you visit {siteConfig.domain}. By using the site you agree to the
          practices described here.
        </p>

        <h2>Information we collect</h2>
        <p>
          {siteConfig.name} is a static website. We do not require you to create
          an account and we do not knowingly collect personal information from
          visitors. We may receive the following limited information
          automatically:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Log data.</strong> Basic request information such as IP
            address, browser type, referring page, and timestamp, retained only
            as long as needed for security and diagnostics.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cookies.</strong> The site itself does not set tracking
            cookies. Embedded third-party content (for example linked maps or
            videos) may set their own cookies if you interact with them.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Analytics.</strong> If analytics are enabled in the future,
            we will use a privacy-respecting provider and update this page
            before doing so.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How we use information</h2>
        <p>We use the limited information we receive to:</p>

          <li>Diagnose technical problems and prevent abuse.</li>
          <li>Understand which content is useful so we can improve it.</li>

        <h2>Sharing</h2>
        <p>
          We do not sell personal information. We do not share it with third
          parties except as required by law or to protect our rights and the
          safety of our users.
        </p>

        <h2>Third-party links</h2>
        <p>

        <h2>Your choices</h2>
        <p>
          You can block cookies and limit data collection in your browser
          settings. Disabling cookies will not affect your ability to read the
